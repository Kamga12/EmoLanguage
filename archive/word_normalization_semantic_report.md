### Regular inflections should normalize
**Accuracy**: 80.0% (4/5)
**Issues found**:
- quick ‚Üí quickly: normalized to (quick, quickly)

## Recommendations

üìù **Review case-by-case decisions** - refine semantic impact assessment
üîç **Address edge cases** - add special handling for problematic word patterns
üéØ **Improve professional roles should remain distinct from actions** handling

### Priority Actions
1. Fix high semantic impact errors first
2. Review and refine case-by-case evaluation criteria
3. Add special rules for identified edge cases
4. Validate improvements with expanded test coverage
