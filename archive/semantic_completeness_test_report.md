## Recommendations
üîß **Improve encoding accuracy** by reviewing failed test cases and updating mappings
‚ö†Ô∏è **Address high failure rate** by analyzing common failure patterns
üìù **Review transformation rules** - some decisions may need refinement
üîç **Review agent noun handling** in normalization rules
üîç **Review irregular comparative handling** in normalization rules
üîç **Review manner adverb handling** in normalization rules
üîç **Review plural irregular handling** in normalization rules

### Next Steps
1. Review detailed test results for specific issues
2. Update normalization rules based on findings
3. Add exception handling for identified edge cases
4. Re-run tests after improvements
5. Consider expanding test coverage to more domains
