# Changelog

All notable changes to the Emo Language Encoder/Decoder project will be documented in this file.

## [2025-08-14] - Multi-Pass Generation & Context-Aware Processing

### 🐛 Fixed - Save-Time Collision Detection Bug
- **Issue**: Resolved collision mappings were incorrectly flagged as collisions during save operation
- **Root Cause**: Collision detection was checking against stale data when words were getting new mappings in the same batch
- **Solution**: Enhanced `_save_mappings_to_file()` to properly clean up old mappings before collision detection
- **Impact**: Prevents resolved words like 'dirk' and 'barb' from being incorrectly re-queued after successful collision resolution

#### 🔧 Technical Fix:
- Added batch-aware collision detection that removes old mappings for words being updated
- Improved reverse mapping cleanup to prevent false positives
- Enhanced logging to distinguish between real collisions and batch update conflicts

### 🧠 Added - Multi-Pass Generation System
- **Multi-pass quality validation**: Generate multiple emoji candidates across multiple LLM passes with increasing creativity
- **Semantic clustering**: Group contextually related words for better prompt coherence and relationship analysis
- **Consensus building**: Score emoji quality based on consensus across passes, complexity appropriateness, uniqueness, and semantic validation
- **Context-aware prompting**: Include related existing mappings as context to improve consistency and semantic relationships
- **Quality scoring**: Comprehensive scoring system considering multiple factors for optimal emoji selection

#### 🔧 Technical Implementation:
1. **generate_mappings_multipass()**: New method in SemanticMappingGenerator for multi-pass processing
2. **Semantic clustering**: `_cluster_words_by_context()` groups words by morphological and semantic relationships
3. **Context-aware prompts**: `_create_context_aware_prompt()` includes related mappings as examples
4. **Quality scoring**: `_score_emoji_quality()` evaluates mappings across multiple dimensions
5. **CLI integration**: New `--multipass` and `--passes` flags for user control

#### 📊 Quality Improvements:
- **Higher semantic accuracy**: Multiple passes allow exploration of different creative approaches
- **Better consistency**: Context-aware prompts maintain relationships with existing mappings
- **Consensus validation**: Best mappings chosen from multiple candidates based on comprehensive scoring
- **Category tracking**: All multi-pass mappings tagged with quality scores for analysis

### 🎯 Enhanced - Command-Line Interface
- **--multipass flag**: Enable multi-pass generation for higher quality results
- **--passes N**: Control number of LLM passes (default: 3) for consensus building
- **Quality feedback**: Real-time progress indicators and quality metrics during generation

## [2025-08-13] - Semantic-First Generation Strategy

### 🎯 Enhanced - Batch Generation Strategy
- **Removed existing emoji constraints** from batch generation prompt to allow semantically optimal emoji selection
- **Semantic-first approach**: LLM now chooses the most appropriate emoji for each word without being limited by existing assignments
- **Collision resolution focus**: Let the collision resolution system handle duplicates rather than preventing optimal semantic choices
- **Benefits**: Words like "man" can now get 👨 even if it's already assigned, leading to better semantic accuracy

#### 🔧 Technical Changes:
1. **BATCH_GENERATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE** no longer includes `{{existing_emojis}}` input
2. **Removed existing emoji constraints** from batch generation rules and checklist
3. **Updated prompt formatting** in `generate_mappings_batch()` to not pass existing emojis
4. **Enhanced collision system reliance**: Collision resolution now handles all duplicate emoji assignments

## [2025-08-13] - Prompt Strategy Enhancement for Word Complexity

### 🎯 Enhanced - Mapping Strategy Based on Word Complexity
- **Simple word strategy**: Use single emojis for basic objects, actions, and emotions when perfect matches exist
  - Examples: "cat" → 🐱, "happy" → 😊, "book" → 📖, "tree" → 🌳
- **Complex word strategy**: Use multi-emoji combinations for abstract concepts, compound meanings, and specialized terms
  - Examples: "democracy" → 🗳️⚖️🏛️, "photosynthesis" → 🌱☀️🔬, "entrepreneurship" → 💡🏢📈

#### 📝 Prompt Updates:
1. **BATCH_GENERATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE** updated with complexity-based mapping guidance
2. **COLLISION_RESOLUTION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE** updated with same strategy for consistency
3. **Clear examples** provided for both simple and complex word handling
4. **Semantic completeness** prioritized for complex concepts while maintaining simplicity for basic words

### 🧹 Removed - Experimental Code Cleanup

   - `"fox"` gets 🦊 (not cunning/clever symbols)
   - `"tree"` gets 🌳 (not growth/nature abstractions)

2. **CONCRETE over ABSTRACT**: Physical objects over conceptual meanings
   - `"clock"` gets 🕐 (not time management symbols)
   - `"book"` gets 📖 (not knowledge symbols)
   - `"hammer"` gets 🔨 (not construction symbols)

3. **SPECIFIC over GENERAL**: More specific words claim direct emojis
   - `"rose"` gets 🌹 (over generic flower)
   - `"bicycle"` gets 🚲 (over generic transport)
   - `"guitar"` gets 🎸 (over generic music)

4. **COMMON USAGE over RARE**: Everyday words get priority
   - `"house"` gets 🏠 (over "dwelling" or "residence")
   - `"car"` gets 🚗 (over "automobile" or "vehicle")
   - `"dog"` gets 🐕 (over "canine" or "hound")

5. **UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION**: Cross-cultural comprehension priority
   - Avoid region-specific symbols unless word is region-specific
   - Prefer widely understood visual meanings

#### 🔧 System Improvements:
- **Enhanced `semantic_mapping.py`**: Updated prompts with prioritization rules and examples
- **Fixed `resolve_duplicate_mappings.py`**: Simplified from complex batch structure to simple word→emoji format

3. **Improved Semantic Accuracy**: Priority system ensures best possible word-emoji connections
4. **Simplified Processing**: Cleaner LLM response format reduces parsing complexity
5. **Better Documentation**: Clear guidelines for manual review and quality control

#### 📋 Usage Examples:
```
Prioritization in action:
- "abacus" → 🧮 (literal object wins over abstract calculation)
- "fox" → 🦊 (direct animal wins over cunning symbolism)
- "bicycle" → 🚲 (specific transport wins over generic movement)
- "rose" → 🌹 (specific flower wins over generic nature)
```

#### 🔄 System Integration:
Both `semantic_mapping.py` and `resolve_duplicate_mappings.py` now use consistent prioritization rules, ensuring semantic accuracy across:

- **1-2 Points**: Minimal distinctiveness - pure grammatical variation

#### 🔧 Decision Matrix for Classification
1. Creates new dictionary entry? (Yes → PRESERVE)
2. Requires separate learning for non-natives? (Yes → PRESERVE)
3. Changes core referential meaning? (Yes → PRESERVE)
4. Obligatory in grammatical system? (Yes → ELIMINATE)
5. Creates antonymical relationship? (Yes → PRESERVE 9-10 points)

#### 💡 Implementation Applications
- **NLP Systems**: Apply stemming only to ELIMINATE category (1-4 points)
- **Semantic Analysis**: Preserve PRESERVE category (7-10 points) as distinct tokens
- **Search Systems**: Conflate only low-scoring grammatical variations
